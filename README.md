DASHbored is a dynamic, interactive web application that aims to centralize most of the tools used to suppress your boredom. We recognize that much of your boredom may be solved by having access to recent global and sports news, events happening in your area, restaurants around you, as well as games to help pass the time. As a visitor, youâ€™ll be given access to all available modules. However, as a registered BoredMember, instead of displaying what we believe you want to see, DASHbored allows you to customize your dash based on what you want to see as well as update your preferences should your tastes change.

To accomplish this we used PostgreSQL for our database, Express Generator for our application code, Knex.js, Handlebars and Bootstrap CSS framework for our grid layout. Most of our CSS is custom written and only utilized Bootstrap for its grid capabilities. Our workflow strategy was to pair program as much as possible. Having more cooks in the kitchen worked well for our group. We knocked out our core features to get us to an MVP and then moved on to some of our stretch tasks to improve the application further.

# My role in the project
* Since this was a team project, we rotated to different sections throughout the course of the week. I worked on setting up the server and building out the RESTful routes. I worked on hitting the different remote APIs to get their data back and formatting it. I wrote the logic that displayed the user's preferences based on the modules they wanted to see. I also created a separate branch and incorporated a mobile swipe library that ultimately did not make it into the final build, but was still fun to tinker with.
